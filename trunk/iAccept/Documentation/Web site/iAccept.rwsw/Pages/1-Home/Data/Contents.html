What is iAccept?

<p>iAccept is an automated acceptance testing framework for the IOS development platform. It is written in Objective-c.</p>

<H1>Who is it for?</H1>
<p>For any IOS development team who is building software incrementally or iteratively, agile or not.</p>
  

<H1>Why would we need that?</H1>
<p>If you do any kind of iterative development, you need to know that you haven't broken previous functionality every time you make even simple modifications to your software.
As it gets larger, it often becomes impossible to retest everything manually whenever a change is made because it simply requires too much time. Furthermore, manual
testing is often the first thing to go under schedule pressure and product quality suffers, with potentially catastrophic consequences to the customers and the
development organisation if dangerous bugs get out in the open. In agile development, the automated acceptance tests defines the contract that tells developers
what they should be building. Since the tests are automated and binary in nature (pass or not), they also act as an objective measune of progress.

<H1>Why iAccept and not other IOS automated accceptance testing frameworks?</H1>
<p>Before we decided on developping our own framework, we tried a number other automated acceptance test frameworks. It was all very frustratung because we just could not get anything to work in a reasonable amout of time. 
<br><br>Problems included :
<ul>
<li>No easy way to get up and running and see tests in action using exemples.</li>
<li>Extremely poor documentation.</li>
<li>Code that simply does not run in the latest version of xcode.</li>
<li>Code and/or examples that straight out did not work.</li>
<li>Too many different technologies involved to get up and running.</li>
<li>Dependency on static libraries that just don't work anymore.</li>
</ul>

<br>In short, we wanted to see if we could adress these issues and really help out the IOS development community.

<H1>How does iAccept work?</H1>
<ol>
<li>You create an acceptance test project in your project and install the iAccept library.</li>
<li>You define your acceptance tests.</li>
<ul>
	<li>A test simply manipulates the application through the UI directly (via the UI API) or using fixtures (provided by the developers)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Testing the UI directly allows you to test applications that have not been designed to be tested.</li>
		<li>If your are lucky enough to be starting from scratch, fixtures give you extreme flexibility as they provide direct hooks into your application. </li>
		<li>Fixtures often abstract the functionality of single windows, and makes tests well organized and much easier to write. </li>
	</ul>
	<li>A test consits in a number of statements.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Statements can be actions you take on the UI (push a button).</li>
		<li>or valide the state of the the UI (is the checkbox checked).</li>
		<li>or even valide the state of the application if you use dixtures (is there really another Employee in the database after I press the save button?).</li>
		<li>Statements can also wait for conditions to become true (wait till some asynchronous message has been received from a socket).</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<li>You then run the tests by simply running the acceptance test project.</li>
<ul>
	<li>iAccept starts the application (in the simulator or on the device).</li>
	<li>It then runs each test, one statement at a time against the application asynchronously.</li>
	<li>As it does, it outputs the test results on the console or in a file.</li>
</ul>
<li>It can easily be integrated in a continuous integration environment since the test application returns 0 if the tests passed and -1 otherwise. You can see the test results by outputing to a file instead of simply outputing to the console.</li>
<li>That's it, simple isn't it?</li>
</ol>

<H1>What it's not!</H1>
<ul>
<li>It is not an IDE for acceptance testing that can be used by non programmers.</li>
<li>There is no recorder that allows you to manipulate the application and somehow create your test definitions from that.</li>
<li>As of now, there is no higher level language to allow non programmers to write tests. Although, you could create fixtures that would suppport that... </li>
<li>Tests need to be written by developers although they can be specified by the product owner independently.</li>
</ul>
