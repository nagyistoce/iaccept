This page presents the basic concepts used in iAccept.


= Details =

*Feature* : a feature corresponds to a unit of functionality of the software under construction. It is a use case or a user story. An excellent format suggested by Mike Cohn is the following : As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit).

*Scenario* : a scenario typically represents an acceptance criteria of a specific Feature. This is where things get extremely concrete since the scenarios contain the details of the feature. Scenarios either pass or don't pass. iAccept uses  a Gherkin like syntax. Gherkin is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language created especially for behavior descriptions. The general form is the following : Given (the system is in a known state), when (an action is taken), then (the system produces the desired outcome).

*Statement* : a scenario is composed of a number of Given/When/Then statements. Gherkin calls them steps. We just think "statement" is more explicit and user friendly...

*Fixture* : fixtures allow the test framework to control and query the state of the application under test. It is the glue that allows the Domain Specific Language to be executable.
