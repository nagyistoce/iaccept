*Feature* : a feature corresponds to a unit of functionality of the software under construction. It is a use case or a user story. An excellent format suggested by Mike Cohn is the following : As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit).

*Scenario*: a scenario typically represents an acceptance criteria of a specific Feature. This is where things get extremely concrete since the scenarios contain the details of the feature. Scenarios either pass or don't pass. iAccept uses  a Gherkin like syntax. Gherkin is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language created especially for behavior descriptions.
The general form is the following. Given (the application is in a certain state), when (the user does something), then (the system reacts in a certain way).
