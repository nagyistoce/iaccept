In this simple tutorial, we will build a new application to show you how to get started from scratch.  If you have experience with Objective-C and iOS development, you can skip directly to the FirstTest wiki page that will show you how to add acceptance tests to an existing project.

We"ll be building a very simple Hello World application.

Before we start, you must have Xcode installed on your mac.  This tutorial is done with Xcode 4.3.

Here we go!

Step 1 : Open Xcode and click on "Create a new Xcode project".

Select iOS Application -> Single View Application has template.

Choose the location of your project and click Create.

We now have a new single view project.

Because we want to do ATDD (Acceptance tests driven development) we begin our project by setting up iAccept.

The first thing to do is to create a new target for our tests.  This way, our tests wont be embedded in our application and we will be able to ship it without any dependency to the test framework.

At the bottom of the screen, click on the Add Target button.  You must be in the project settings.

You will then see the template screen.  Choose Empty Application.

Click next and enter the new target's details.  I like to use the name of my application prefixed with "at" standing for "acceptance tests".

Click Finish.

We now have our test taget.  To be able to use iAccept, we must link the iAccept framework with our target.  Go in the atHelloWorld target settings, and click the summary tab.  Scroll down until you see the "Link Frameworks and Libraries" section.

Click the + sign and the bottom of the section and thne click the Add Other... button.

Navigate to the location of the iAccept framework you downloaded from the Downloads section of this site and select the unzipped framework.  Click Open.

You can now see the iAccept framework in the list.

iAccept has a dependency on the MapKit framework from the iOS sdk.  You must add this dependency by clicking the + button then add the MapKit framework under IOS 5.0.

Your linked frameworks list should look like this:

Open the atHelloWorld target in the tree in the left pane of Xcode and delete the files ETAppDelegate.h and ETAppDelegate.m.  Sinc atHelloWorld is the test target, we dont need those files.

The time has come to write code.  Go in the main.m file of atHelloWorld target.
