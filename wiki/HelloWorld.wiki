Hi,

in this simple tutorial we will build a new application to show you how to get started from scratch.  If you have experience with Objective-C and iOS development, you can skip directly to the First Test wiki page that will show you how to add acceptance tests to an existing project.

Here we go!

First, you must have Xcode installed on your mac.  This tutorial is done with Xcode 4.3.

Open xcode and click on "Create a new Xcode project"
