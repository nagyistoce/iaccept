Hi,

in this simple tutorial we will build a new application to show you how to get started from scratch.  If you have experience with Objective-C and iOS development, you can skip directly to the First Test wiki page that will show you how to add acceptance tests to an existing project.

Here we go!

First, you must have Xcode installed on your mac.  This tutorial is done with Xcode 4.3.

Open xcode and click on "Create a new Xcode project".

Select iOS Application -> Single View Application has template.

Click next and enter your Application details.

Choose the location of your project and click Create.

We now have a new single view project.

Because we want to do ATDD (Acceptance tests driven development) we begin our project by setting up iAccept.

The first thing to do is to create a new target for our tests.  This way, our tests wont be embedded in our application and we will be able to ship it without any dependency to the test framework.

At the bottom of the screen, click on the Add Target button.  You must be in the project settings.

You will then see the template screen.  Choose Empty Application.

Click next and enter the new target's details.  I like to use the name of my application prefixed with "at" standing for "acceptance tests".

Click Finish.
